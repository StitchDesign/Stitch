#  Version Migration Tutorial

Follow these instructions if you plan to make a change to any schema.

## Create a New Schema Version
1. From Xcode, create new folder group in `Stitch/Graph/StitchAI/GraphPrompting/Model/SchemaVersions` with the new version. For example, the folder group should be named "V2" if the most recent version was "V1".
2. In your terminal, go to the package root (`StitchSchemaKit/`) and invoke the shell script as such:
```sh
# (Only on first ever invocation) enable permissions of this script
chmod +x versioning.sh

# i.e. if the next version is 3: "./versioning.sh 3"
./versioning.sh <new-version-number>
```
3. Add new files as target to Xcode project.

## Rename References
### Find + Replace
1. From Xcode, do a find + replace command to replace references of the old with new version (i.e.`_V2` -> `_V3`). **Make sure to restrict search to the folder location of the new version folder group.**
2. Find + replace on the old previous version. If V3 is the new version, replace `_V1` with `_V2`.
3. Lastly, find + replace any pointers to SSK types that were used.

### Last Steps
1. Add new `StitchSchemaVersion`, incrementing the number. Fix compiler warners for missing case in switch statements.
2. Update the type aliases at the top of the SchemaVersions.swift file.
3. If necessary, update commented code in `StitchAIRuntimeHelpers.swift`.

## Tips
* **Please mark custom migration code with `// TODO: ...` comment code.** It makes identifying custom migration code easier for subsequent versions.
* In the Stitch codebase, use the `DEV_DEBUG` scheme if you expect to make more edits to the schema version. This fixes migration issues caused by making changes to existing versions.
