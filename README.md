# Stitch

Prototyping. Apple first. Touch enabled. iPad, iPhone, macOS with more devices coming soon. Open source.

## What is Stitch
Weâ€™re an Apple first, open source, and community driven prototyping environment.

Stitch follows in the footsteps of giants, namely [QC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_Composer) and [Origami](http://origami.design).

We created Stitch to solve three main problems:

1. Open Source
2. Modern Apple Frameworks
3. Community Driven

The history of visual programming languages a wonderful one, but it has its woes. The two biggest examples [QC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_Composer) and [Origami](http://origami.design), are both examples of side projects for bigger companies and neither is open source. When QC became defunct, Facebook worked on creating Origami to fill the gap left by it. If QC was open source, Facebook wouldnâ€™t have had to start from scratch. Not to discredit the incredible team at Facebook, but weâ€™ve noticed Origami isnâ€™t really their main focus. Itâ€™ll also never support things like ARKit and the Vision Pro for obvious reasons. There are so many wonderful people out there who relay on these tools for their work, and have incredible ideas on how to improve them, we think the world would be a better place with an open source, completely community driven visual programming language.

Weâ€™re excited to give others a tool to use and one they can improve themselves. Itâ€™s going to be insane to see what the community creates.

Weâ€™ve also built Stitch on top of Appleâ€™s modern frameworks, so itâ€™d a first class citizen across your devices. Including on your Mac, iPhone, and on your iPad, and once we have the time (or if a community member can help us ðŸ˜‰) the Vision Pro. We joke that maybe someday we can find a reason to support the Apple Watch, too.

It syncs all your documents via iCloud, so theyâ€™re all in one place and work across all your devices. Also theyâ€™re all private to you and only you.

You and use and import USDZ (Appleâ€™s primary 3D model format) and use them with ARKit primitives.

You can import your CoreML models (or use oneâ€™s we supply) to use powerful AI in your prototypes.

Weâ€™re active on GitHub and on Campsite(link). Join us, help us improve with ideas and code. 

We genuinely believe the world is a more interesting and wonderful place with easy ways to prototype your ideas, and have dedicated very nontrivial amounts of time and effort to help this cause.

## Who made it (last section)

Weâ€™re a group of passionate engineers and designers who share a love for Apple and prototyping. Weâ€™re mainly living in SF, but have contributors from all over.
* Chris
* Elliot
* Adam
* Nick
* Josh

With a board of VPL advisors:
* Mike
* Brandon
* David

Join in and help us, weâ€™ll be keeping this list up to date.


## GraphEngine (not in main readme)
What is the StitchEngine? â€¦ Elliot+Chris to write something up

#### Will be in open sourced?
Weâ€™re definitely open to the idea. Our thoughts right now are they itâ€™s a small library thatâ€™s likely to not change very much. We were able to clean up our code and ship it faster by keeping this in a separate package. Our hope is that no one will ever really need or want to change it, but if thatâ€™s not true, please [shoot as an email](mailto:us@stitchdesign.com) â€” weâ€™d love to hear from you. Our ideas here are likely to evolve and grow over time.
