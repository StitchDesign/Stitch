# Stitch (Beta)

![header](README_Assets/airbnb-monthystays.png)

Weâ€™re an open source, Apple first, and community driven prototyping environment.

Stitch works accross iPad, iPhone, macOS with Vision Pro coming soon. Apple Watch too if anyone wants. ðŸ˜†

We're in beta and have so much more we want to give.

## What is Stitch
Stitch follows in the footsteps of giants, namely [QC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_Composer) and [Origami](http://origami.design).

We created Stitch to solve three main problems:

1. **Make it Open Source:** Freely available for everyone to modify and extend.
2. **Modern Apple Frameworks:** Base it on the latest from Apple. iCloud Syncing, SwiftUI, and support on every device they create.
3. **Touch first:** We're weirdly in love with the iPad, but it needs more powerful software. We're trying to help fix that.
