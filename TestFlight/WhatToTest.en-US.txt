3D & AR Prototyping
- Reality Layer now acts as a layer group and makes adding 3D layers easier
- Added Box, Sphere, Cylinder, and Cone layers
- Translation, scale, and rotation gesture support for 3D layers
- Easier AR anchor input selection with new dropdown for all 3D model layers
- New 3D transform matrix input for layers to make matrix changes easier

App Improvements
- Overhauled graph movement and zoom gesture handling for native iOS behavior
- Introduced a new “Debug Mode” project open option for editing fields without running the prototype
- Specify alignment for HStack and VStack layer groups
- Support for creating multiple graph nodes for a field when multiple layers are selected via sidebar
- Improved formatting for numeric values with many decimals
- Up/down arrow keys increment or decrement number fields
- Click a wireless receiver’s icon to jump to its assigned broadcaster

Bug Fixes
- Graph reset no longer breaks the Repeating Animation node
- Fixed camera direction mismatch for newly created reality nodes
- Fixed UI field updates and node selection when entering group node
- Fixed issues with out-of-date UI fields after application boot
