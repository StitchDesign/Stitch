New Features
 - Hold Option to duplicate sidebar items during drag
 - Copy layer nodes for easier reuse
 - Added color arithmetic operations: multiply, divide, add, subtract, length, and mod
 - Expanded math patches to support loops and extra inputs
 - Mac device info node support
 - DeviceMotion node uses sensible defaults when no motion manager is present
 - Updated zoom shortcuts (0.1 key step, 0.04 mouse step) while ignoring borders during zoom
 - Screen sharing lets you share prototype recordings
 - Bulk node editing: change multiple selected patches' node types or splitter types at once
 - Drag the bottom edge of a patch node to add or remove inputs instantly
 - Hover a canvas field to reveal its full value for quick checks
 - Inside a project, CMD + N now creates a new project instead of opening the node menu

Improvements
 - Row view models refresh fields when items scroll into view
 - Layer multiselect editing behaves consistently when fields are on the canvas
 - Inspector no longer shows shadow inputs for 3D layers
 - Text layers default to “auto” sizing for smoother layout
 - UI field updates keep pace with group hierarchy changes
 - Port preview popovers close only when the graph itself is tapped
 - Graph items persist correctly after a cut operation
 - Layer “ephemeral” states reset on graph reset for a clean slate
 - Preview layers regenerate whenever orientation inputs change
 - Outputs start empty on graph reset or project open, avoiding carry-over values
 - Projects open centered on the canvas
 - Preview window sizing is updated when importing projects
 - Zooming out is smoother near the maximum limit
 - Copy-paste logic respects groups, keeps relative positions, and removes invalid edges
 - Splitter positioning and staggering are smarter
 - Classic animations finish correctly even with very short durations
 - Friendlier port preview on iPad
 - Distinct icons for Text versus TextField layers
 - Wider dropdowns and better flyout padding
 - Pack and Unpack patches hide redundant fields for a cleaner canvas
 - Numerous visual polish tweaks to z-ordering, hit areas, and field labels
 - Sound Import nodes restart reliably when prototypes reload

Bug Fixes
 - Time-zone handling corrected in the Time Formatter node
 - Patch connections can no longer loop back to the same layer or patch
 - JSON subarray ranges of length one now decode correctly
 - Camera mirroring fixed on Catalyst builds and orientation is consistent
 - Unpacked Margin and Padding values render correctly in the Layer Inspector
 - Microphone node functions as intended during graph playback
 - Prototype restarts no longer mute Sound Import nodes
 - Edge-animation glitches resolved outside edit mode
 - Loop insert and remove operations no longer stall graph execution
 - Copying layers no longer leaves behind invalid traversal edges
 - Input parsing now validates node type before updating fields
 - Numerous stability fixes across graph and layer memory handling
 - Hidden preview window no longer blocks areas on canvas

Performance
 - Reduced redundant rendering across fields, nodes, layers, edges, and sidebars
 - Lowered render cycles for project titles, ports, node titles, edges, and navigation elements
 - Improved media handling performance with StitchEngine
 - Decreased graph “jumpiness” by removing excess momentum code
 - Faster graph initialization for snappier responsiveness
 - Fewer render passes when only on-screen ports change
 - Safer identity handling and lower memory overhead for layers
 - Smaller app footprint thanks to fewer demo prototypes in the gallery
 - Additional optimizations to field updates, flyouts, and copy-paste for smoother editing
