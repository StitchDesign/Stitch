Introducing layer pinning: a new way to easily “pin” one layer to another in a prototype. Layer pinning enables precise layer placement regardless of layer group context.

Other improvements:
* Fixed performance regression caused by updates to node ports
* 3D model entity transforms simplified to no longer include “Rotation Real”
* Transform pack + unpack fixed to produce consistent results
