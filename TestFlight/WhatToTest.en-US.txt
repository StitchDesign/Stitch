Introducing layer pinning: a new way to easily “pin” one layer to another in a prototype. Layer pinning enables precise layer placement regardless of layer group context.

3D model improvements:
- Custom 3D transforms no longer cause objects to disappear in 3D Model layer node
- 3D transforms simplified to no longer include “Rotation Real”
- Transform rotation values use degrees instead of radians
- Transform pack + unpack fixed to produce consistent results

Other improvements:
- Fixed performance regression caused by updates to node ports
- Added sound metering for Sound Import node
- Layer inspector ports fixed to show “Add Node” button on hover
- Small improvements to node searches in Insert Node menu
- Layer padding and marge edits use “flyout” menu
